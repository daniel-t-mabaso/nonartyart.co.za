# Non-Artistic Art

Hi, this is the copy of the live Non-Artistic Art Website as of 17 June 2023. The website was created a few years back and I'm decomissioning the servers so I decided to back everything up on github.

Non-Artistic Art was my graphic design and web design company that I created while I was still in high school in the early 2010s. A copy of the first website should be on here. Check the Archives section below if you wanna see my truly humble beginnings, lol.

## Other Projects Contained
On top of the company website, there are some projects that I worked on that I would test by uploading to this service (both personal and for business).

Below is a list of all the various completed and incomplete projects you'll find in this repo.

DISCLAIMER: Some of these would connect to the DB and, because my php skills we're super good at the time, these will simply break when you access them, instead of showing a lovely message.

# Repo Map
Here's what's in the repo, in alphabetical order. If you simply wanna go digging and see what you'll find, skip this part entirely and start the digging cause... well, it's self-explanatory.

## Root directory
The root is the live nonartyart.co.za website that clients would visit to learn a little about the business.

## /apps
This was supposed to be a list of apps that the company release, only a single test Android app was ever released. You'll find it here. Don't remember how or even where I made it.(if I used another service instead of coding it myself)

## /archive
You'll find the first two iterations of the business website here. The first is just in /archive and the second in /archive/NAA. The second went through a "testing phase" or so I thought, but before even releasing it, I changed the design completely to the on that you see in root.

I also worked on a redesign for the current site, but never really took that anywhere. You can see the design language in /archive/i_m_BETA where people could register to be testers and get a discount on their next project. This same design language can be seen across other pages as well.

## /cms
A CMS I created to make creating client websites easy. It's broken. Dig in and checkout my dirty code. You can try fix it if you have the time, then you'll see what it used to do.

## /daniel
My personal bio. Works as it was intended. Made this when I was expirementing. Check it out and see if you can see what the experiment was.

## /digitank
A client website. Got redesigned before we finished and the new home page for the redesign is 2020 below. I quit midway through the redesign.

## /digitank_2020
I simply copied the previous version and was redesigning page by page based on the designer's figma designs. I quit after the home page.

## /documents
The first terms of service for my business, lol

## /elaborate
Client website for my friend. I didn't have it in me to get it done so I stopped the project.

## Tired of typing
I'm tired of typing. You can just dig in to the other stuff. I was quite happy with the design I made for /prestige though. That was a template I made for the CMS.
